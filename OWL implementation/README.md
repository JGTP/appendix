### How to use OWL files?

Previously, OWL files could be opened in WebVOWL by navigating to the VisualDataWeb website. You could simply go to 'Run WebVOWL' -> 'Ontology' -> 'Select ontology file' and upload the downloaded OWL file. This is no longer the case. Instead, go here: <https://github.com/VisualDataWeb/WebVOWL>.

Alternatively, the OWL files can be opened in Protégé (<https://protege.stanford.edu/>).
