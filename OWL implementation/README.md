-   HTML export of a Jupyter notebook from our data exploration phase containing classification results (view outside BitBucket)

### How to use OWL files?

OWL files can be opened in WebVOWL (<http://vowl.visualdataweb.org/webvowl.html>). Simply go to 'Run WebVOWL' -> 'Ontology' -> 'Select ontology file' and upload the downloaded OWL file. Alternatively, the OWL files can be opened in Protégé (<https://protege.stanford.edu/>).
